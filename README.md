A Lesson presents to your students a series of HTML pages of either lesson content or questions (which can be graded or not).

A lesson page generally requires students to make some sort of choice once they have read the content or answered the questions.
Their choice determines which page they are shown next in the sequence.

When to use
You can create very simple sequences within the Lesson tool, or you can set up complex, many-branched structures that tailor the learning
very closely to students' needs. 

Benefits
If planned well, a lesson can present content and questions that can be customized to individual students with no further intervention from the teacher.

This is useful when you are, for example, orienting a class of students in your course whose basic knowledge level you are unsure of; you
can lead students through the information, indicate to those with less knowledge the kinds of reading they should do to catch up, 
or direct those who find the questions impossible to contact their tutors for assistance.

A Lesson can also be used effectively for managing formative assessments in the course.
